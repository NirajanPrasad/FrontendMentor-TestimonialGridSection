      <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in teh company I
        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>
      <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have
        heard some people who had and amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was teh best - and most gruelling - time of my
        life. Since sompleting the course, I've successfullly switched careers, wrking as a Softwere careers, working as
        a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

      <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
      <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
        can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of their who can only
        say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for asssistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
        It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial culd ever have. In fact, I've often referrd to
        it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainliy helped me land a job as a
        full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommed! "</p>

      <h3>Awesome teaching supprot from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance form them and learning
        from their experiences was easy. </h3>
      <p>" The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really fefreshing. The program gave me the
        confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable juinor developer. The
        standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need form and increadible community of smart
